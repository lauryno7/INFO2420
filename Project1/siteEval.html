    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>
            <p>I think the site is so fun! There are very cute colors, pictures, fonts, etc. The layout as a
                whole is easy to read and navigate. The inclusion of specific recipes and new product info is 
                very helpful. 
            </p>
        <li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
            on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
            <p>The site does have a few links on the left, but there is also a main drop down
                menu at the top left. If you scroll down the home page, there is also a number of links
                to different sections of the site. The layout is very organized and easy to follow.
            </p>
        <li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
            <p>The site structure mostly makes sense. I think it could be a little better honestly, maybe with
                a few more links/sections on the left side, or a drop down that is more intuitive on the home page.
            </p>
        <li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
            it? Why?</li>
            <p>I think it enhances it. Trader Joe's is known for their cute art and designs around
                their stores and on their packaging, and I think they've done a great job of incorporating
                that into their website. It's not too much by any means, in my opinion. 
            </p>
        <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
            reasonable?</li>
            <p>The load time was very reasonable. It only took a second or two at most.</p>
        <li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
            image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
            <p>Yes, it was very readable. A background image was not used, and the site itself looks
                to be an off-white color which keeps it simple and clean looking. 
            </p>
        <li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
            navigation well done?</li>
            <p>It was pretty well done, I think. As mentioned before, I think it could be better.
                But all things considered, it's pretty good. There just seems to be more clicking than
                necessary to get to certain sections.
            </p>
        <li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
            the pages?</li>  
            <p>Yes, the same color scheme was used across the board. Each page featured similar colors,
                fonts, and layouts. The only thing that changed was the content of the page itself.
            </p>
        <li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>  
            <p>It responds quite well. I shrunk the page and made it larger, skinnier, fatter, etc.
                and the site adjusted very well. 
            </p>
        <li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>  
            <p>I think the incorporation of the recipes was very well done. It made the site feel cute and 
                personal. There were different options using many of their products which I appreciate
                about this site a lot. It seems to appeal to a lot of different types of customers.
